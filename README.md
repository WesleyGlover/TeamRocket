Sometimes 2 people need to meet halfway (more or less) between where they are.  
Common examples are custody exchanges or trying to meet a relative/friend who is 
passing through on a trip.  It should have features like noting any favorites, suggesting 
nearby restaurants or police stations.  Users need to be able to enter their address and 
the app gives them options on where to meet (that are near something â€“ so not in the 
middle of nowhere) based on their needs (e.g., at a police station).
